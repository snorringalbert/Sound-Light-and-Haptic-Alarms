## Welcome to the Sound, Light and Haptic Alarms app support page

This application listens to sounds around you. When the sound is heard, the device on which the application is installed will signal it. In the case of a free option, the device vibrates. And if additional options are purchased, the device can be configured to also send sound and light signals.
The sensitivity of the device and the duration of the alarm can be configured.
If the device works for a long time with the application turned on, it is recommended to connect the power supply.
